Multi-Threaded DNS Simulator
=============================

In the DNS simulation, a trie is used to store the mappings of host names to IP addresses.

Thread programming has been used for the DNS simulation.

*Note : In this project, the aim is not to build a true DNS server
        but the aim is to write a simulator which consists of the typical
        requests a DNS server would see.
